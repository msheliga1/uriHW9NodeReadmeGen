## Project Goals  
Use node and the fs and inquirer libraries to create a README.md file based upon answers to inquirer prompts.  

==================================================================================================================   ## Technical Project Details    
===================================================================================================================  
## Github:   
    Create Repo (github, repositories => New)   
        - Dont Make this a shared repo.  
    Copy directories and sample files from prior project (or create from scratch).  
        -- No starter code. No need for copying one file at a time via command line.  
        -- Alternate: Go to Demo (root) folder, download zip, moving to local repo, unzip - likely fastest method.     
        -- Could not find a better way to copy over all files.    
        -- OR ... create HTML, CSS and javascript, etc. from scratch or sample files ...   
    Branches (Optional for single programmer projects)  
        - Could do work in branches. (new branch inside gitHub)    
        - All branch names will begin with the initials of the main person working on the branch.  
        - Must update local repo after adding a branch  
        - Switch to branch: From cmd line git switch <branchname>   
        - Once changes committed, git push origin <branchname>  
            - for pushing to remote test branch: git push origin local_branch:remote_branch  
        - Issue a pull request in gitHub.  
        - Click "Pull Requests" in top menu bar (3rd from left).  
        - Click "review Required" in small font below pull request name.  
        - You may approve your own request.  
    Clone to local machine (Copy https, then git clone paste).    
    Create a nice long READ.md file!!  (Modify prior projects.)   
    Commit and push files back to gitHub/branch. (For multi-programming: Issue pull request, approve, merge).  
    Deploy code (Settings...CodeAndAnimation->Pages on left, GitHub Pages->Branch->main, save)  
        - Deployed code name always msheliga1/github.io/RepoName !!  
    Make Sure it Works   
    Insert Vidoe and/or Screenshot X2 of deployment into readme file. 
  
## Tools and Technologies Used - HTML, CSS BootStrap Framework and JQuery   
    Github - Branches not needed, but could use.  
        - GitIgnore to keep NPM libraries out of gitHub repo.
    NPM - Node Package Manager
    fs - fileSystem   
    inquirer - Used for prompts (text, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.)
    Agile - Try to assign a little work at a time.
